# pwgenerator aka PassWord Generator (homework assignment #3)

This was a project/homework assigment given by bootcampspot. We were given starter javascript to work with and further develop using Javascript
to create a random password generator based on user-selected criteria.

Currently this webpage is up and running on github, I will show the links to the repository and the webpage below. The source code will be available
as well.

## Useful Links

This is a quick link to a video of the application in use: https://watch.screencastify.com/v/xXqRwwnDHNvC2RGYt5SV

Link to the github repository: https://github.com/rickyesc1/pwgenerator

Link to the application itself: https://rickyesc1.github.io/pwgenerator/

## How to access the code:
Make sure you have a text editor that can run code, I use VS Code on windows and Xcode on Mac.
The code is downloadable directly as a zip file or you can use the ssh key to clone into a repo on your home machine.

## Overview of the PassWord Generator

The random password generator is made using html, CSS styling, and javascript, with an emphasis on JS dynamics and how they can afect a webpage.

    Features of the password generator:
        a generate button, on-click the window alert function is activated and a prompt with yes and no options appears. This is where the user
        selects the criteria that they want the password to have. Options are upper and lowercase lettters, numbers, special characters, length,
        and then the random password is given to be on-screen.

        A text area where the password between 8 and 120 characters is displayed

        I wanted to implement a copy button but at the time of writing it is not there.

        
## How it works:
The user is supposed to click the generate password which then prompts the window alert to ask the user to select from a few criteria. Length of password
between 8 and 120 characters, and then special characters, upper and lowercase.
